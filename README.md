# PCB_Design_Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my previouus work in PCB design and fabrication. it includes pictures of various PCBs  that i have designed and fabricated using Altium Designer.
my PCBs includes:
  1) RF circuit for LoRaWan wireless and Bluetooth Low Energie (BLE) Wireless data communication.
  2) A highly constraint Power supply circuit to comply with the ATEX explosive zone safety requirement
  3) A dual band RF communication circuit for BLE 2.4Ghz and LoRaWa 868Mhz, using RF switch to switch between each wireless communication
  4) RF matching circuit  making sure that all RF line impedance match the antenna impedance (50Ohm)
  5) Usage of highly sophisticated IMU sensor (MEMS technology) : Accelorematers (BHI160), Magnetometers,...
